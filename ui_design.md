# Travel Agency Database UI Design

## Overview
The Travel Agency Database UI will be a comprehensive interface for managing all aspects of a travel agency's operations. The UI will be built using Tkinter and will follow a tab-based structure similar to the template, but expanded to cover all entities in the database schema.

## Main Window Structure
- Main application window with a notebook (tabbed) interface
- Each entity will have its own dedicated tab
- Common UI patterns will be used across tabs for consistency
- Responsive layout that adjusts to window resizing

## Common UI Components

   - Sortable columns
   - Selection capability for CRUD operations
   - Scrollbars for navigation

2. **Entity Detail View**
   - Form for viewing/editing entity details
   - Input validation
   - Clear feedback on operations

3. **Action Buttons**

4. **Search/Filter**
